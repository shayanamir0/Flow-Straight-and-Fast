# Rectified Flow

This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper ["Flow Straight and Fast: Learning to Generate and Transfer Data with Rectified Flow"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03003). It includes core algorithm and visualisations using data points for better understanding. 

It is accompanied by a Notion blog that documents my learning - [Blog](https://www.notion.so/Rectified-Flow-215d9afdcfa280898d40dead37603808?pvs=4)

Hope it helps others as well.
